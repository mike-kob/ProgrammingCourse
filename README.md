# ProgrammingCourse

Here are the biggest projects that I developed completing course of programming in Java in the first year. For graphics I used Stanford Library for learners ACM. There are subdirectories with screenshots of games.

1) DiceGame - the game based on the Witcher Dice Pocker (rules: https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/The_Witcher_dice_poker ).

2) Game - simple game, the main goal of which is to repair the road with holes. The game goes forever, but when you're bored, ther's button "Stop" to end the game.

3) TicTacToe - simple relization of tictactoe for two players. When the winner is determined, the game shows the message and suggests to restart the game.
